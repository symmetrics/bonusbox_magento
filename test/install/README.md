# Bonusbox's magento test systems

The sql file is based on version 1.4.0.0 and can be upgraded to every magento version (this is done on the first request and takes several seconds). 
It contains the required configuration and minimum data (products, taxes, customer, sales rules) for a bonunsbox demo. 
Open the file "local.xml", copy it to app/etc/local.xml and set the database connection params.
